DEFINITION:
Linear Regression: find hyposesis function mapping x to y, the line/curve!
    Process: training set -> learning algorithm -> finally get hypothesis function (function works by iteself)
    Univariate LR: one variable(one feature)

    Notation: a list of m training examples (x(i),y(i));i=1,...,m
      All in all, goal is, given a training set, to learn a function h : X â†’ Y 

    Thoughts: h(x) = theta0x1 + theta1x2 + theta2x3 + ... thetaK, LR is just to find these thetas
  
COST FUNCTION:
    One example is square error function [sum of square difference to the h(x) vs. real value y] * (1/2m or something others) make the number smaller.
    Purpose is to minimize the cost function to get theta0,1....
    
    Cost Function - Intuition I
      Cost function: J(theta) = square error function including theta (cost function has a graph based on different theta value)
      Find the minimum of THIS! -> which is find theta which minimize the square error function -> WIN
      
      Sometimes, find lowest point in certain range of cost function is acceptable.
